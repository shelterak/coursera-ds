# coursera-ds
This repo is for all the work completed during my studies for the Data Science Specialization offerd by Coursera.

I'm originally from Outdoor Studies, but my passion for finding solutions for real-world problems using data, like lost person behavior, sparked my interest in data science.

I'm also working as the statistician on a study using dogs to detect breast cancer.
